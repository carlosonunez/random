# Carlos's Random Scripts

These are one-liners, Bash scripts, Go programs, or whatever other junk I needed
to come up with to solve a specific problem.

## Some assembly required

These things are untested and will probably never be. I am not responsible for
any damage you cause by running these!

They might have security issues; sorry in advance!

Feel free to leave an issue, but it might take me a while to get to fixing it!
